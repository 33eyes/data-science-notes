# Randomized controlled trial  

## Definition  
A study design that randomly assigns participants into an experimental group or a control group.  
As the study is conducted, the only expected difference between the control and experimental groups in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) is the outcome variable being studied. ([source](https://himmelfarb.gwu.edu/tutorials/studydesign101/rcts.cfm), accessed 2023-07-12)
